        <h1>Distance Geometry Processing</h1>
        <p>
            According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_geometry">Distance Geometry</a> is "the branch of mathematics concerned with characterizing and studying sets of points based only on given values of the distances between pairs of points".
            In the following set of blog posts, I hope to develop an adjacent theory of <i>Distance Geometry Processing</i>, in which popular geometry processing algorithms are re-formulated in a coordinate-free way, using only the edge lengths &mdash; or 
            <i>discrete metric</i> &mdash; of the given mesh. If the need for these algorithms seems esoteric to you, then try adapting 
            <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall05/cos528/handouts/A%20Simple%20and%20fast.pdf">this algorithm</a> for 
            triangulating 2D polygons to work in 3D and come back to this article when you've finished. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If its been 3 months and you're crying and shivering, your job lost and engagement called off
            because you've spent every waking hour thinking about this problem, then hopefully you'll be relieved to hear this: 
            unlike in 2D, not all 3D polygons are triangulatable, and deciding whether a 3D polygon is triangulatable is actually NP-complete!
            Futhermore, the problem can also be ambiguous since valid triangulations can have significantly different visual properties.

            <i>Both of the triangulations on the right are valid for the polygon on the left.</i>
        </div>
        <p>
            To narrow the search, it can be useful to optimize for some heuristic to get the most "correct" triangulation; 
            for example, minimizing the area or maximizing 
            the minimum triangle angle (to obtain a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_Delaunay_triangulation">constrained Delaunay triangulation</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            I could get into the joys of polygon triangulation in another day, but hopefully from this example it's easy to understand why 
            it might be useful for there to be an approach that works independent of the embedding's dimension.
            I hope to show that a coordinate-free perspective not only nicely generalizes to multiple dimensions (and not to mention, can be easier to implement), 
            but also possibly reveals some deeper properties of the result. 
            They can also be useful when adapting geometric algorithms to use metrics that aren't derived directly from the coordinates of an embedding 
            &mdash; more on this later.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the first article of this series, I'll show a neat little coordinate-free algorithm for calculating the lengths of geodesic paths.
