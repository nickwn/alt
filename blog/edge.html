        <h1>Constrained Delaunay Edge Insertion</h1>
        <p>
            In this post, we'll take a short break from distance geometry processing to focus on a new algorithm for adding edges to Delaunay triangulations.
            Specifically, this algorithm inserts a new boundary edge into a Delaunay triangluation in which the boundary edges have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_Delaunay_triangulation">constrained</a> &mdash; 
            that is, a triangulation that satisfies the Delaunay property as long as the triangles' circumcircles are "chopped off" at the boundary of the triangulation.
            We assume each new boundary edge forms at least one new triangle in the triangulation. Boundary edges that become interior lose their constraints.

            </i>
        </div>
        <p>
            This algorithm might seem a little esoteric right now, but I promise it will become useful for a few different distance geometry-related algorithms down the road, which I plan to cover in future blog posts.
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, it's interesting to note that if our boundary-constrained Delaunay triangulation is convex, then the triangulation is also just a normal unconstrained Delaunay triangulation.
            The algorithm described in this post is pretty much a modified version of the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/282918.282923">G&S</a> triangulation stitching procedure, so I'll spare a lot of the details and proofs.
            To show this, I'll use the same "rising bubble" visual that G&S use.
        </p>
        <h2>Algorithm overview</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine a circle constrained to pass through the endpoints of the newly added edge. 
            We wish to find the first point touched by the circle as it moves into the interior of the triangulation.
        </p>
        <div class="center">

        </div>
        <p>
            Clearly, the triangle formed by this point and the new edge cannot have any other points contained in its (constrained) circumcircle.
            Once we find this triangle, we can continue applying the same procedure to push the circle further into the interior to find the next neighboring triangles.
            The recursion stops once we hit an edge that already existed in the original triangulation (and is therefore already Delaunay).
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            Let <i>basel</i> be the newly inserted edge, and let <i>lcand</i> and <i>rcand</i> be the candidates for the edge forming the next triangle on the left and right side, respectively.
            We proceed exactly as the G&S algorithm does: we delete <i>lcand</i>/<i>rcand</i> if the destination of the next counterclockwise (resp. clockwise) edge is inside the triangle formed by <i>base</i> and the current <i>lcand</i> (resp. <i>rcand</i>).
            In the above example, we delete <i>lcand</i>:
        </p>
        <div class="center">
            <img src="edge_vars2.svg" width="70%" class="invertible">
        </div>
        <p>
            And connect the next edge as usual, repeating the process with a new <i>basel</i>:
        </p>
        <div class="center">
            <img src="edge_vars3.svg" width="70%" class="invertible">
        </div>
        <p>
            When we reach a point where nothing left needs to be re-triangulated (<i>lcand</i> and <i>rcand</i> form a triangle with <i>basel</i> and both don't need to be deleted), we can terminate the procedure.
            The code itself is also pretty similar to G&S, so I leave it as an exercise to the reader.
