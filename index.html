            <h3>Hello!</h3>
            <p>
                I'm Nick, a sofware engineer currently working at SideFX. 
                I'm interested in anything and everything computer graphics, but specifically geometry processing.

                During my master's at UCSD, I did some <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10115">research</a> 
                on adaptive meshing with Professor <a href=""https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~alchern/">Albert Chern</a>.
                Before that, I developed height map tessellation techniques as an intern at Adobe, 
                created a GPU path tracer for medical scans at UCSD's <a href="http://ivc.ucsd.edu/">IVC</a>, and worked on 
                cinematic tools in Unreal Engine's editor as an intern at Epic Games.

                I also have a tentative <a href="blog/index.html">blog</a>.
